This process led me to conceptualise a shared subscription model. The idea allows groups of people to collectively donate through a monthly subscription, with each member contributing an equal amount. A key feature of this product is its ability to visually demonstrate the impact of donations over time, addressing the users' desire for transparency and tangible results. This approach not only aligns with ActionAid's mission but also caters to donors' preferences for flexible, transparent, and impactful giving experiences.",

I focused on creating a user flow that would allow small groups of friends or family to create a group, invite others, and track their collective donations over time. Through multiple iterations and rough sketches, I explored various layouts and features. This iterative process helped me identify the most effective ways to present key functionalities and ensure a seamless user experience.",

    challenges_title: "Design Challenges",
    challenges_text1: "During the initial design phase, I had set up the group subscription model with a single payment date for all members, determined by the group creator. However, user testing revealed a potential flaw in this approach. Participants pointed out that individuals within a group might have different preferred payment dates, often aligned with their respective paydays. This insight highlighted the need for a more flexible payment system that could accommodate diverse financial schedules, prompting a re-evaluation of the subscription model to ensure it would be accessible and convenient for all potential donors.",
    challenges_text2: "Another design challenge I encountered was the potential for changing donation amounts within a group. Initially, I considered allowing the group admin to modify the donation amount for all members, assuming they would obtain group consensus beforehand. However, this approach risked creating conflicts if the admin increased the amount without unanimous consent. To prevent potential distrust among group members, I ultimately decided to keep the donation amount fixed once a group is established. Instead of allowing changes, I encouraged users to create new groups with different donation amounts if they wished to contribute more, ensuring transparency and maintaining trust within existing groups.",
    challenges_text3: "By refining the solution, I made the product scalable beyond small groups of friends or family. The model could easily accommodate entire football teams, local communities, or even entire companies. This scalability not only increases the potential impact of donations but also broadens the product’s appeal to diverse groups, making it a more powerful and versatile fundraising tool.",

The design is firmly rooted in four key user insights: personal connection, impact, affordability, and community. These pillars have guided the development of a desktop version that prominently features the number of groups formed and the total money raised. Moving forward, I aim to refine and expand this concept, exploring ways to enhance the user experience, increase engagement, and maximise the product's potential for fostering a culture of giving.",
