    title2: 'The Design Process',
    text: "I used the Double Diamond design process to Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver a solution I began with stakeholder interviews, user surveys, and competitor research to shape a clear problem statement. Then guided by insights from an affinity map, persona, and empathy map, I progressed through ideation, wire-framing, and prototyping, I made a user centred prototype that addresses key workflow challenges for medical receptionists.",

    title3: "Stakeholder Interview",
    text2: "In the stakeholder interview, talked about the product’s transition from a payment tool to a multichannel communication platform, designed to improve workflows and address cross-platform communication challenges. Success will be measured by saving time for reception teams, improved rebooking rates, and an increase in patient satisfaction through more personalised interactions.",

    text3: "I made a user survey to get an idea of how the general population communicates in the work place. This further validated insights gained  from the stakeholder interview as well as giving me the opportunity to screen for receptionists that work in the medical field.",
    image8: "/images/coherent-usersurvey.png",
    title6: "User Interviews",
    text4: "Through interviews with several receptionists, I uncovered key pain points such as inefficient booking processes, the reliance on paper, and the need for an all-in-one digital system with automated responses to streamline communication and reduce workload. I supplemented these findings with desk research from forums and articles to deepen my understanding of user needs and challenges, particularly around transitioning to fully digital workflows.",

    affinity_text: "I synthesised the data from the interviews with an Affinity Map. This revealed that receptionists juggle multiple tasks daily with some areas of their work having the potential of being automated, although many interactions still require a personal touch. While they use digital tools, these are often fragmented, creating inefficiencies. There is strong interest in a streamlined, unified system that will enhance both workflow and client satisfaction.",

She is overwhelmed by her workload and shift handovers. Sally values tools that reduce stress and streamline communication, with automation for routine tasks while maintaining personal touches. This persona helped me focus my design on practical, supportive solutions for receptionists with similar challenges.",

After checking the Appointments tab and finding no openings on the requested date, the receptionist checks the following week, finds availability, and sends it to the patient using the “Send Availability” button. A toast message confirms the availability has been successfully sent.",

This is where I developed the idea for a modal with tabs for Conversation, Notes, and Outcomes to streamline message interactions and enable appointment booking directly through a familiar calendar interface, ultimately enhancing efficiency for receptionists.",

    digital_wireframes_text: "After creating the digital wireframes, I began testing the user experience to identify improvements. Initially, users often missed new message notifications located in the top-right corner of the dashboard, so I repositioned them centrally in the high-fidelity prototype for better visibility. The modal window for messages tested well, though I renamed the Outcomes tab to Book Appointments in the high-fidelity version, making it a clearer, actionable feature in the user flow. Wireframes",

    mid_text: "In developing the mid-fidelity prototype, I incorporated Coherent's brand colours for a clean, readable interface. Ease of use and clarity were top priorities for me, which lead to refine the usability with features like automated responses for appointment searches and toast notifications confirming each automated action. I also added functionality to allow users to toggle and edit the templates of automated responses, putting receptionists in full control of patient communications.",
    mid_video_title: "Checking messages",
    mid_video_text: "In this video, we demonstrate the first user flow where a receptionist receives a patient's email requesting an appointment. After checking availability for the requested day and finding no openings, the receptionist notes the patient is free on Tuesdays and checks the next Tuesday, discovering available slots. The receptionist then sends these options to the patient. This process highlights the intuitive design of the appointment management system and its use of automatic responses, which will be covered in the next video.",
