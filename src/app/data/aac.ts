    overview_sentence: "In the journey to empower children with autism to communicate effectively, parents often encounter unique challenges, particularly during the critical early stages of using Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems. One key stage in this process is Modelling. This is where caregivers guide children in associating symbols and images with words to develop language skills. Modelling can be demanding, requiring the right tools and strategies to seamlessly integrate AAC into everyday interactions.",

    dev_text: "This app was inspired by years of personal and secondary research into autism, combined with invaluable insights from parent coffee mornings at my son's autistic school. Conversations with speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, teaching assistants, and other experts revealed a significant gap in AAC Modelling tools. I redesigned the interface to address these challenges, incorporating features like enhanced search functionality, PEC categorisation, and prediction based on user history. Using React, I built an MVP that enables users to search PECs via voice or text, dynamically display results, and save combinations for repeated practice. Starting with low-fidelity wireframes in Figma, I refined the app iteratively and prioritised accessibility, creating a tool that is simple, intuitive, and impactful. I now plan to conduct formal user interviews and apply a full UX/UI design process to further improve the product.",

    next_text: "Moving forward, I plan to conduct in-depth user interviews to uncover additional insights and address pain points that may not have been apparent during the initial development phase. By integrating these findings into a comprehensive UX/UI design process, I aim to refine the app’s functionality and usability to better serve the needs of AAC trainers and learners. This iterative approach will ensure the product is not only innovative but also deeply aligned with the real-world challenges faced by its users, making it an even more compelling solution struggling with communication.",
